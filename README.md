## Description

This app was created with React and is my portfolio that I will use while applying for development positions. The homepage is a condensed bio that includes a picture. The navbar allows you to choose "Projects", "Contact Form", or "Resume". Projects will contain apps that I am proud to display. The contact form is to meet requirements of the homework assignment, but will be removed after grading. After removal, it will just contain my contact information. The Resume tab currently will send the user directly to my resume on Google Docs.

## Installation

After creating the React app, I installed "react bootstrap". That must be installed to get the correct view on localhost.

## Usage

This will be used in my process of applying for development positions. It will stay updated with current projects, contact information, and resume.

## Contributing

If there was any desire to contribute, I can be contacted personally(check Questions below). I do not believe that there should be another contributor as this is built and maintained by myself.

## Tests

If the desire to test comes up, jest would be used as that is already allowed for within React.
