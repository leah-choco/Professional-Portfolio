        I currently reside in Middle Tennessee. Juan, my husband, and I are
        raising three children. We recently decided that I should complete a
        coding bootcamp to be certified in MERN. I am incredibly motivated to
        continue my education. This is the place to find links to my projects,
        and to all the other resources showing my work and experience.
